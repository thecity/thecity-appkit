    %p.intro.grid_5.suffix_3 We're happy about that. We have provided a few tools for you. We hope these tools will make it easier for you to make your app fit nicely within The City.
    %p.grid_5.suffix_3 We've put together and hosted a stylesheet for you to include in your app. This will provide you with the basic styles that we use in The City. To place it in your app, paste the following in the head of your document:
